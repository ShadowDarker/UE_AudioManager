Example of basic audio manager subsystem with some functions to handle music.

A blueprint subclass of the audio manager can be created and referenced in **AudioManagerSubsystemSettings** to create an instance of it.

It makes use of a **MusicData** data asset to collect audio assets and configuration identified by an string ID. The manager handles the music elements through the available functions using their ID.
